# spencer-queue
custom spencer library with queue and simple command line

This is a modification of Spencer firmware from CircuitMess. With this code and my Custom_spencer_library (also found here on GitHub) Spencer can synthesize multiple sentences one after the other through the build in FIFO.
It is also possible to use custom commands to show different effects on the display. These commands can be send through Serial connection.
Use the "help" command to show all possible commands and small examples to use it for your needs.
